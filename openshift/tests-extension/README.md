# OLMv1 Tests Extension
========================

This repository contains the OLMv1 tests for OpenShift.
These tests run against OpenShift clusters and are meant to be used in the OpenShift CI/CD pipeline.
They use the framework: https://github.com/openshift-eng/openshift-tests-extension

## How to Run the Tests Locally

| Command                                         | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make build`                                    | Builds the OLMv1 test binary.                                            |
| `./bin/olmv1-tests-ext info`                    | Shows info about the test binary and registered test suites.             |
| `./bin/olmv1-tests-ext list`                    | Lists all available test cases.                                          |
| `./bin/olmv1-tests-ext run-suite olmv1/all`     | Runs the full OLMv1 test suite.                                          |
| `./bin/olmv1-tests-ext run-test -n <test-name>` | Runs one specific test. Replace <test-name> with the test's full name.   |

## Development Workflow

- Add or update tests in: `openshift/tests-extension/tests/`
- Run `make build` to build the test binary
- You can run the full suite or one test using the commands in the table above
- Before committing your changes:
    - Run `make update-metadata` or `make build-update`
    - Run `make verify` to check formatting, linting, and validation

## How to Rename a Test

1. Run `make list-test-names` to see the current test names
2. Find the name of the test you want to rename
3. Add a Ginkgo label with the original name, like this:

```go
It("should pass a renamed sanity check",
	Label("original-name:[sig-olmv1] OLMv1 should pass a trivial sanity check"),
	func(ctx context.Context) {
		Expect(len("test")).To(BeNumerically(">", 0))
	})
```

4. Run `make build-update` to update the metadata

**Note:** Only add the label once. Do not update it again after future renames.

## How to Delete a Test

1. Run `make list-test-names` to find the test name
2. Add the test name to the `IgnoreObsoleteTests` block in `main.go`, like this:

```go
ext.IgnoreObsoleteTests(
    "[sig-olmv1] My removed test name",
)
```

3. Delete the test code from your suite (like `olmv1.go`)
4. Run `make build-update` to clean the metadata

**WARNING**: Deleting a test may cause issues with Sippy https://sippy.dptools.openshift.org/sippy-ng/
or other tools that expected the Unique TestID tracked outside of this repository. [More info](https://github.com/openshift-eng/ci-test-mapping)
Check the status of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRT-2208 before proceeding with test deletions.

## E2E Test Configuration

Tests are configured in: [ci-operator/config/openshift/operator-framework-operator-controller](https://github.com/openshift/release/blob/master/ci-operator/config/openshift/operator-framework-operator-controller/)

Here is a CI job example:

```yaml
- as: e2e-aws-techpreview-olmv1-ext
  steps:
    cluster_profile: aws
    env:
      FEATURE_SET: TechPreviewNoUpgrade

      # Only enable 'watch-namespaces' monitor to avoid job failures from other default monitors 
      # in openshift-tests (like apiserver checks, alert summaries, etc). In this job, the selected 
      # OLMv1 test passed, but the job failed because a default monitor failed. 
      #
      # 'watch-namespaces' is very lightweight and rarely fails, so it's a safe choice.
      # There is no way to fully disable all monitors, but we can use this option to reduce noise.
      #
      # See: ./openshift-tests run --help (option: --monitor)
      TEST_ARGS: --monitor=watch-namespaces

      TEST_SUITE: olmv1/all
    test:
    - ref: openshift-e2e-test
    workflow: openshift-e2e-aws
```

This uses the `openshift-tests` binary to run OLMv1 tests against a test OpenShift release.

It works for pull request testing because of this:

```yaml
releases:
  latest:
    integration:
      include_built_images: true
```

| `make list-test-names`   | Shows all test names in the binary.                                          |
| `make clean-metadata`    | Removes machine-specific codeLocations from the JSON metadata. [More info](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRT-2186) |

**Note:** Metadata is stored in: `.openshift-tests-extension/openshift_payload_olmv1.json`

## FAQ

### Why don't we have a Dockerfile for `olmv1-tests-ext`?

We do not provide a Dockerfile for `olmv1-tests-ext` because building and shipping a 
standalone image for this test binary would introduce unnecessary complexity.

Technically, it is possible to create a new OpenShift component just for the 
OLMv1 tests and add a corresponding test image to the payload. However, doing so requires 
onboarding a new component, setting up build pipelines, and maintaining image promotion 
and test configuration â€” all of which adds overhead.

From the OpenShift architecture point of view:

1. Tests for payload components are part of the product. Many users (such as storage vendors, or third-party CNIs)
rely on these tests to validate that their solutions are compatible and conformant with OpenShift.

2. Adding new images to the payload comes with significant overhead and cost. 
It is generally preferred to include tests in the same image as the component 
being tested whenever possible.

### Why do we need to run `make update-metadata`?

Running `make update-metadata` ensures that each test gets a unique and stable **TestID** over time.

The TestID is used to identify tests across the OpenShift CI/CD pipeline and reporting tools like Sippy. 
It helps track test results, detect regressions, and ensures the correct tests are 
executed and reported.

This step is important whenever you add, rename, or delete a test.
