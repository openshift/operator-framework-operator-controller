                          description: |-
                            channels is an optional reference to a set of channels belonging to
                            the package specified in the packageName field.

                            A "channel" is a package-author-defined stream of updates for an extension.

                            Each channel in the list must follow the DNS subdomain standard
                            as defined in [RFC 1123]. It must contain only lowercase alphanumeric characters,
                            hyphens (-) or periods (.), start and end with an alphanumeric character,
                            and be no longer than 253 characters. No more than 256 channels can be specified.

                            When specified, it is used to constrain the set of installable bundles and
                            the automated upgrade path. This constraint is an AND operation with the
                            version field. For example:
                              - Given channel is set to "foo"
                              - Given version is set to ">=1.0.0, <1.5.0"
                              - Only bundles that exist in channel "foo" AND satisfy the version range comparison will be considered installable
                              - Automatic upgrades will be constrained to upgrade edges defined by the selected channel

                            When unspecified, upgrade edges across all channels will be used to identify valid automatic upgrade paths.

                            version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.

                            Acceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.
                            Version ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or
                            more comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional
                            comparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).

                            # Range Comparisons

                            To specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like ">=3.0,
                            <3.6". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that
                            range. The example comparison string means "install any version greater than
                            or equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.". It also states intent that if any
                            upgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,
                            those upgrades should be automatically performed.

                            # Pinned Versions

                            To specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that
                            "pins" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no
                            automatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is
                            "0.6.0", which means "only install version 0.6.0 and never
                            upgrade from this version".

                            # Basic Comparison Operators

                            The basic comparison operators and their meanings are:
                              - "=", equal (not aliased to an operator)
                              - "!=", not equal
                              - "<", less than
                              - ">", greater than
                              - ">=", greater than OR equal to
                              - "<=", less than OR equal to

                            # Wildcard Comparisons

                            You can use the "x", "X", and "*" characters as wildcard characters in all
                            comparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:
                              - "1.2.x", "1.2.X", and "1.2.*" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0"
                              - ">= 1.2.x", ">= 1.2.X", and ">= 1.2.*" is equivalent to ">= 1.2.0"
                              - "<= 2.x", "<= 2.X", and "<= 2.*" is equivalent to "< 3"
                              - "x", "X", and "*" is equivalent to ">= 0.0.0"

                            # Patch Release Comparisons

                            When you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you
                            can use the "~" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:
                              - "~1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <1.3.0"
                              - "~1" and "~1.x" is equivalent to ">=1, <2"
                              - "~2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <2.4"
                              - "~1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <1.3.0"

                            # Major Release Comparisons

                            You can use the "^" character to make major release comparisons after a
                            stable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:
                              - "^1.2.3" is equivalent to ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0"
                              - "^1.2.x" is equivalent to ">=1.2.0, <2.0.0"
                              - "^2.3" is equivalent to ">=2.3, <3"
                              - "^2.x" is equivalent to ">=2.0.0, <3"
                              - "^0.2.3" is equivalent to ">=0.2.3, <0.3.0"
                              - "^0.2" is equivalent to ">=0.2.0, <0.3.0"
                              - "^0.0.3" is equvalent to ">=0.0.3, <0.0.4"
                              - "^0.0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <0.1.0"
                              - "^0" is equivalent to ">=0.0.0, <1.0.0"

                            # OR Comparisons
                            You can use the "||" character to represent an OR operation in the version
                            range. Some examples:
                              - ">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 || >3.0.0"
                              - "^0 || ^3 || ^5"
